Here is the notebook for elementary students to have an interactive experience with AI.  

It is hard for them to understand machine learning algorithms such as decision tree ,linear regression. However, analogies, visual aids and hands-on coding experience can help them have AI intuition. They can witness how machines learning from data and how to make data-driven decisions.  

I choose the example of dog-cat classification, using decision tree algorithm to find the solution to it. Because decision tree is easy to understand for those without knowledge of college-level mathematics.
